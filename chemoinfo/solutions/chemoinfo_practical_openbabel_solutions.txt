Answers to chemoinformatics practical (openBabel)

To reveal warnings run babel with:
---errorlevel 5
(this is not necessary for answering the questions but allows you to check what the reported warnings are)


To add a title and hydrogens at pH 7.4 (assuming you have a SMILES string in the file viagra.smi and you
want to produce an SDF formatted file as output):

babel -ismi viagra.smi -osdf viagra.sdf -p 7.4 --title Viagra

Explanation of the CHG line: First number defines the number of charges (up to 8 on a single line).
Each charge consists of two 4-character fields. The first is the index of the atom, the second is the charge
for that atom.

Producing a 3D structure from sdf with no coordinates in it doesn't seem to work (at least when I tried it):
obgen viagra.sdf > viagra3d.sdf

However, the 3d generation will work if done directly from the SMILES string:
obgen viagra.smi > viagra3d.mol



To add hydrogens to an existing 3d mol file:
babel -p 7.4 -imol viagra3d.mol -osdf viagra3d.sdf



To search an SDF formatted file with a SMARTS pattern (make sure the pattern is within quotes):
obgrep 'C1C2C(CCC1)CCC3C2CCC4C3CCC4' -isdf 1equ_ligonly_edited.sdf > 1equ_steroids.sdf

(this particular pattern describes the steroid rings in the wikipedia page for “steroid” and returns
6 hits back).
You can try alternative patterns e.g.

obgrep 'C4C1C(=CCC2C1CCC3C2CCC3)CCC4' 1equ_ligonly_edited.sdf > 1equ_steroids.sdf

(which returns only 3 hits - you  get a different number if you
are using a different pattern)



To split up the file of hits so that they can be visualised better in Chimera:
babel -m -isdf 1equ_steroids.sdf -osdf 1equ_steroids
You probably need to rename the output files so they have a .sdf ending (babel does not seem
to always recognise the files, if they have no extension in their name).

To calculate properties of the molecule in the SDF file: 
obprop 1equ_ligonly_edited.sdf



To superimpose steroid 2 on steroid 1 using a SMARTS pattern (in this case just the 5-member
ring):
obfit 'C1CCCC1' 1equ_steroids1.sdf 1equ_steroids2.sdf > 1equ_steroids2_on_1.sdf
